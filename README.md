# Practical Haskell (with test suite!)

Hello everyone, this repository has a dual use:

    - The files in the `src/` folder are my own solutions to the exercises contained in [Practical Haskell](https://www.apress.com/9781484244791), a book by Alejandro Serrano Mena. I encourage you to ignore these files: instead either try to write your own solution, or look at the "official" accompanying code available [here](https://github.com/Apress/practical-haskell).

    - The files in the `test/` folder are my (very much work in progress) attempt at writing a test suite for the book. I chose to use Tasty, simply because I'm more used to it.
